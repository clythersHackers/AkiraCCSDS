# Goal

Develop a CCSDS TM TC support for AkiraOS in src/connectivity/ccsds

# Non-goals

Do not redesign AkiraOS.
Do not update Zephyr unless explicitly asked.
Do not edit generated build files.
Do not scan the whole Zephyr tree unless necessary.
Do not make broad refactors.
Use Zephyr & AkiraOS documentation of official API's before scanning

# Known target

Board: akiraconsole_esp32s3_procpu
Host: Fedora Linux
Container: VS Code devcontainer
Build command: ./build.sh -b akiraconsole
CCSDS verification build command: ./build.sh -b akiraconsole --ccsds

# Debugging rule

When a build fails:
1. Quote the first real compiler/config error.
2. Identify whether it is environment, dependency, board config, Zephyr API mismatch, or source error.
3. Propose one minimal change.
4. Do not attempt more than one fix at a time.

# Documentation rule

User manuals should describe supported user-facing behavior and workflows, not
temporary implementation status or roadmap notes.
Use plans, design notes, or task trackers for incomplete feature status,
limitations under active development, and future work.

# Error handling rule

For embedded code, use assertions for programmer contract violations when the
caller has no meaningful runtime recovery path. Reserve error returns for
recoverable runtime conditions or inputs that are expected to vary in normal
operation. Functions without meaningful error returns should return void

# Task focus

1. Development of CCSDS protocol features in src/connectivity/ccsds
2. Allow registering of CCSDS I/O on different device interfaces (e.g. UDP, UART, RF, ...)
